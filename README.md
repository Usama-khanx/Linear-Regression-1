# Linear Regression Using Python

It's a simple implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python and Scikit-learn.

##  Objective
To understand how linear regression works by predicting salary based on years of experience.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code

##  Description
The model is trained on a small dataset containing years of experience and corresponding salary values. After training, the model predicts the output and visualizes the regression line.

##  Output
- Displays slope and intercept
- Shows a regression line with actual data points

##  Future Improvements
- Use real-world datasets
- Add train-test split
- Implement multiple linear regression
